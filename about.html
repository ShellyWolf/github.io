<p> Michelle Wolf is a ceramicist, photographer and digital media artist. She grew up in Oceanside, California, visiting the ocean almost every day, which created such a connection that it became deeply engraved throughout her artistic practice. Wolf received her AA from MiraCosta Community College in Oceanside but after moving to San Jose and beginning her undergrad at San Jose State University Wolf was unable to continue making frequent trips to the ocean. Pushing her to find inspiration from other forms of natures beauty. Living so close to redwood trees pushed her love out of the ocean and into the forest where she found a myriad of interesting insects, flowers, trees, and landscapes. Enrolling in a environmental science class to get a better understanding for the local environments, changed the course of her artistic career and altered the way in which she lived her everyday life. As she hadn't previously been aware of  the tragic state of the environment due to various forms of pollution, massive amounts of degradation, and the frightening conditions being created by our societies. 
	A strong desire to help alleviate these problems drive Wolfâ€™s life in and outside of her artistic practice. She creates work to encourage others to look at the scientific facts and face the reality that we are damaging the very planet that gives us life.  It promotes a world where we hold each other, corporations, governments, and ourselves accountable for the well being of the planet we should be protecting. Asking her viewers to question the ways in which they care for and treat the environment. 	
	Wolf  is focusing on creating unglazed high fired ceramics sculptures of animals and ecosystems that are being affected. Leaving the clay unglazed to symbolize the loss of life for the objects and almost a ghost like present. Within this body of work Wolf is currently working on a collection that will be compromised of a number of endangered animal sculptures that will each incorporate multiple wheel thrown pieces. Each piece will be thrown separate and later formed together to create individual animal heads. Each full head will be accompanied by a mirroring sculpture of the skeletal system of the same animal. Forcing the viewer to address what will inevitably happen to these creatures if we do not take action. Each of the animals chosen can be found on the endangered species list because of human action. </p>
